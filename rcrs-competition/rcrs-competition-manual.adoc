[#purpose]
== Purpose
The manual describes the sequence of tasks to setup and run the RoboCup Rescue Simulation competition on a cluster of Linux computers.

[#general-notes]
== General Notes
This manual assumes the RoboCup Rescue Simulation competition will run in a cluster of Linux machines.

[#requirements]
=== Software Requirements

* https://www.openssh.com/[OpenSSH]
* https://adoptium.net/[Java OpenJDK 17]
* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* Utilities like bash`, `xterm`, `tar`, `7zip`, `gzip`, etc. +
  *Note:* If you are using Ubuntu, all of these utilities are present in the default software repositories.

[#setup]
== Setup
The competition environment is composed of 5 Linux computers, one controller called `controller` and four simulation computer called `c1-1`, `c1-2`, `c1-3`, and `c1-4`. The `c1-1` runs the RoboCup Rescue Simulator, while each other computer `c1-2`, `c1-3`, and `c1-4` runs a specific type of agents (i.e., ambulance teams, fire brigades, and police forces).

[#controller]
=== Installation
In Ubuntu, the installation proceeds according to the following commands.

[source,shell]
.Installation on Ubuntu
----
$ git clone https://github.com/roborescue/rcrs-server.git
$ cd rcrs-server
$ ./gradlew completeBuild
----

You can download the simulation server by cloning the `https://github.com/roborescue/rcrs-server` repository. Clone the simulator server using the command

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/roborescue/rcrs-server.git
----

General Notes:
Getting server access for the first time:
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id rescue@116.203.191.59

Login to the server: ssh -X rescue@116.203.191.59
Validate display is connected by typing in the terminal:
“echo $DISPLAY” or “xcalc”
check.sh -> checks cluster connection

To access the clusters:
Cluster 1: ssh c1-1
Cluster 2: ssh c2-1

Teams names in the scripts: AIT, CSU, MRL, RI1

Preparing for competition day:
nano scripts/remote-control/config.sh -> to select the right day, ex: DAY = Day1, DAY = Final

Copy maps to clusters:
Check map exists in /home/rescue/in_maps/submission_day/
Copy map to /home/rescue/maps/    ->   cp -r paris/ ../../maps/paris3
./copyToServers.sh maps/ -> maps folder should contains maps directly, ex: maps/paris3

Check teams submitted their code:
Teams codes should be in /home/team_name/code/submission_day_time/

Copy new submitted code to clusters:
cd home/rescue/codeDir
rm -rf in/*
rm -rf out/*
./fetchCodes.sh  ->  nano before copying & validate the code version is correct, ex: 10 = day 1 first submission, 11 = day 1 2nd submission….etc
./prepare.sh teams_name (ex: RI1, MRL)
./uploadCodes.sh
cd .. -> go back to rescue folder
./copyToClients.sh code/

Run maps:
./run.sh [cluster_number] [map] [team_name]
Example: ./run.sh 1 berlin1 AIT
./cancelRun.sh (1 or 2) -> if there are any errors

Generate logs:
nano scripts/evaluation/config.py -> make sure teams, maps per day & days are added properly
evalAll.sh -> if this doesn’t work then run evalLog for each team
evalLog.sh [path_to_gz_file] [map] [team_name]
Example: evalLog.sh logs/Day1/kernel/0624-104636-CSU-Yunlu-eindhoven1.gz eindhoven1 CSU

== Notes

evaluation = log execution
code = team code
codeDir = prepare team code
codeDir/in = team code

./fetch Codes to fix copy
nn = variable

./prepare.sh CS | AIT | RIO | MRL

./updateCodes.sh

./copyToClients.sh code/ = copy code to all machines
./check.sh = check all machine connections
./copyToServers.sh  maps/
* maps with the proper numbering

=== Run the competition

./run.sh [cluster number] [map name] [team name]

./cancelRun.sh [cluster number]

=== Update Web Interface
./evalAll.sh

scripts/remote_control/config.sh
scripts/evaluation/config.py

logs/Day1/kernel = Log of teams

./evalLog.sh logs/Day1/kernel/<filename> [map name] [team name]

./gatherLogs.sh
